<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>This app detects notes with a new high-precision algorithm, and then
uses that information to visualise the sound.
Download and play with it just by singing into your phone,
or playing some music in your room!</p>

<h4 id="musical-background">Musical background</h4>
<p>We perceive <strong>sound</strong> through changes in the <strong>air pressure</strong>.
When air pressure vibrates with a <strong>constant rhythm</strong> we call it a <strong>pitch</strong>.
The speed of vibrations is measured throught <strong>frequency</strong>, which quantifies
how many vibrations happen per second (<strong>Hertz</strong>).
The <strong>faster</strong> the air pressure vibrates, the <strong>higher</strong> is the frequency, and the higher the pitch we hear.
<strong>Human ear</strong> can perceive frequencies roughly between <strong>20</strong> and <strong>20,000</strong> Hertz.
The lowest frequency sounds we can hear vibrate 20 times per second.
The highest frequency sounds we can hear vibrate 20,000 times per second.
There is an <strong>infinite continuum of frequencies</strong> between 20 and 20,000 Hertz...
In <strong>music</strong>, we select a <strong>finite</strong> number of frequencies from this continuum and call them <strong>notes</strong>.
Which <strong>specific frequencies</strong> we select determines the <strong>scale</strong> in which the music is composed.</p>
<p>Many musical scales have existed throughout the history of music.
The scales are designed in such a way that the combinations of nearby notes sound good together.
This is not easy to achieve, as the notes that sound good together
need to have a specific frequency ratio between them, such as 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, etc.
But composing music also needs regularity, such that the relationships between
frequencies of notes are preserved throughout the scale from the lowest to highest notes,
while at the same time preserving a similar repeatable structure
in each <strong>octave</strong> (doubling of frequency), so that the music can easily
be played in lower to higher notes.
This is a very difficult problem if you want to preserve perfect
frequency ratios between notes, while at the same time
having repeated structure through octaves. Long story short,
the modern Western music has converged on so-called <strong>chromatic scale</strong>,
where every note has a frequency which is 1.059463 of the
frequency of the note below it. All the notes are equally spaced
from each other in logarithmic space of frequencies, and there are
exactly 12 notes per octave. These notes do not have perfect
frequency ratios of 3/2, 4/3, etc between each other, but they
are "close enough" so that our ear can accept them as "ah ok,
this will do just fine" (though not all people agree).
In exchange for sacrificing the perfect frequency ratios,
the chromatic scale provides us with a nice <strong>structure</strong>
of exactly 12 notes per octave, so that the music can
easily be played in higher or lower notes.
Note that when the modern music is composed, we usually
select a subset of 7 out of the 12 notes in each octave
and use only them, otherwise it's "just too much" for
our brain to process music as a consistent melody. These
scales further break down into various minor and major scales.</p>
<h4 id="configure-sound-input">Configure sound input</h4>
<p>The app <strong>detects 120 notes</strong> in chromatic scale
(12 notes in each octave, over 10 octaves), <strong>starting from</strong> the
highest frequency that is supported by the input sound you
put in. The highest frequency that can be detected from
<strong>digital</strong> sound is determined from the <strong>sample rate</strong>
of the sound, and equals 1/2 of the sample rate. For example,
if you feed the sound at the sample rate of 44,100, the
highest frequency that will be detected is 22,050.
The input sample rate can be selected using the
"Input" icon from the toolbar:</p>
<p><img alt="Input settings" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/input.jpg"></p>
<p>Most of the people will use the input from the microphone.
But if you have an input audio device attached, you can
select to feed the sound from it into the app.
To make the app <strong>react facter to sounds</strong>, select
the <strong>shortest Audio buffer size</strong> available. This
will not affect performance of the app, as it can
handle the sound in real-time, even if the buffer
size was just one audio sample.</p>
<h4 id="visualisations-available">Visualisations available</h4>
<p>The app can display the amplitudes of the notes it detects
in various layouts ("looks"). Some of the looks help perceiving
the related notes better than a simple linear layout, because
they display the notes that are octave apart next to
each other (more on this below).</p>
<p>You can use "Look" icon from the toolbar to
select the preferred visualisation:</p>
<p><img alt="Look settings" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/look.jpg"></p>
<h5 id="linear-visualisation-1">Linear visualisation (#1)</h5>
<p>Displays the amplitides on notes
arranged linearly in a vertical line, with higher notes displayed
higher on the scale. This visualisation is
similar to typical frequency visualisation applications.
Note that the app uses a novel frequency detection
algorithm that does not have the typical noise in the
low frequencies generated by Fourier transform using
short sound windows for detection:</p>
<p><img alt="Linear visualisation" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/look_linear.jpg"></p>
<p>The yellow meters show the current amplitude of each
detected note, whereas the blue meters show the averaged
"trace" amplitude over a recent period of time.
This helps to see if a particular pitch is moving
up or down (for example, if you sing into the microphone).</p>
<h5 id="rectangles-visualisation-2">Rectangles visualisation (#2)</h5>
<p>Arranges all detected
notes into 10 rows of 12 notes each, with every row comprising
one octave:</p>
<p><img alt="Rectangles visualisation" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/look_squares.jpg"></p>
<p>Each rectangle's height corresponds to the amplitude of the detected note.
Looking at a visualisation like this helps to see if
two notes that are octave apart are played at the same
time. This is typical of almost all instruments, as well
as human voice. In the example above, I was just singing
"mmmmm" into the microphone.</p>
<h5 id="bubbles-visualisation-3">Bubbles visualisation (#3)</h5>
<p>Similar to the rectangles
visualisation, with the ony difference that it displays
circles instead of rectangles. The radius of the
displayed circles is proportional to the amplitude
of the detected notes:</p>
<p><img alt="Bubbles visualisation" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/look_bubbles.jpg"></p>
<p>Above, I was also singing "mmmmm" into the microphone,
but I tried to got from lower to higher pitch, and so you
see the blue "tracers" to the left of the big bubbles.
It's more fun when you try to do it yourself, and see
the display in real time.</p>
<h5 id="circle-visualisation-4">Circle visualisation (#4)</h5>
<p>This the one I like the most
when I am listening to rhythmic music. It arranges the
notes in octaves (12 notes) going around the circle,
kinda like a clock. The lowest notes are in the centre
of the display:</p>
<p><img alt="Circle visualisation" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/look_circle.jpg"></p>
<p>Above, I just said "tsss" into the microphone, so you
mainly see the high frequencies (on the outside) being
activated. It's much more fun to watch this in real time.</p>
<h4 id="high-precision-note-detection">High-precision note detection</h4>
<p>You might have noticed the "Precision" option in the "Look" settings.
There are two icons indicating <strong>low</strong> and <strong>high</strong> precision note detection.
Below you can see two screenshots with this feature,
while I am trying to sing the same note into the microphone.</p>
<p>High-precision off:</p>
<p><img alt="Low precision" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/high_precision_off.jpg"></p>
<p>High-precision on:</p>
<p><img alt="High precision" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/high_precision_on.jpg"></p>
<p>The effect on the first picture (with low precision) is called "frequency leakage".
It basically means that, given a finite sample of discrete audio samples, it is
"impossible" to detect a frequency exactly using Fast Fourier Transform (unless the
frequency coinsides exactly with a frequency that FFT can detect exactly).
However, this app comes with a <strong>novel high-precision frequency
detection algorithm</strong> that enables it to overcome the limitations of
Fast Fourier Transform.</p>
<p>Linear visualisation is best viewed with high-precision: off, because
the frequency peaks can more easily be identified by our eye when
they are wider.</p>
<h4 id="configure-zoom">Configure zoom</h4>
<p>Zoom is necessary to control the size of the visualisation elements,
to adjust for the volume of the input sound (we don't call it "volume"
or "scale" as not to confuse with the actual volume of sound or
with musical scales).</p>
<p>Click the "Zoom" button on the main toolbar to view zoom options:</p>
<p><img alt="Configure zoom" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="https://vsound.app/images/intro/zoom.jpg"></p>
<p>By default, Auto-Zoom is turned on, which means that the zoom will
adjust depending on the volume of the input sound. However, you
can turn Auto-Zoom off, and then set the desired zoom manually.</p>
<p>Equalizer option is necessary to adjust for human perception of
the volume of different frequencies. By default it de-emphacises
low frequencies, because our ear is less sensitive to them.
We roughly used ISO-226 standard for the curve in the lower
frequencies, however the frequencies above 800 Hz have
a flat curve, as opposed to ISO-226.</p>
<p>You can disable the equalizer by choosing the second "flat"
option. This will result in you seeing the sizes of elements
proportional to actual amplitudes of frequencies. This
might be useful to mastering sound, but you won't be
able to see much detail in the higher frequencies.</p>
